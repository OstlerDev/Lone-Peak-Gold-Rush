#Gold Rush
##What is Gold Rush?
This website was created by Josh Ostler for a yearly donation drive run by Lone Peak High School. It is a basic front end with a small admin backend that allows the dynamic change of the total.
##How Do I run it?
The website runs on Meteor (http://meteor.com). In order to run it you will need to install Meteor and Meteorite (a simple package manager for meteor).
